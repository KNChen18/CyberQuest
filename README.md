Initial Time Period: 11 weeks

# Purpose
During the last quarter of the Applied Computing program at the University of Washington (Bothell) us seniors were tasked to develop a self-made project featuring the knowledge we developed both in software and our chosen minors study. As my specialty was in Education, I chose to focus on the topic Information Security. The reasoning behind this specific focus is due to the lack of "real and implemented" focus within our education communities. 

As someone finishing their first bachelors degree in the year 2024, something I remember fondly is the first "computer lab" classes I had undergone in elementary. Now what is even more surprising is the lack of bringing these computer labs to the forefront of the communities near and dear to me. As an older sibling and educator for several programs, I noticed the difficulty for technical resources and education for our younger friends.

Where I often found opportunities for youth to receive more STEM based or even "computer education" was often in supplementary camps and courses not easily accesible for students, rather it had to be seeked out by parents themselves. 

This is where CyberQuest comes in. CyberQuest was my project to develop a more modern "game-ified" curriculumn catered to our younger generations. Given the nature of the short time period I had to create some outcomes that I could present, my main focus being the curriculumn. However as I continued to develop and identity my scope I developed a deeper understanding and mission within the accesibility needs of the nature of my project, as educational curriculumn is really only as valuable as it's accesibilty to students and educators.
